Spellz
===========

The ironically misspelled kids spelling game app is for 4-8 year old children of all genders. The initial version is in English only. I'm quickly learning Yupik and version 1.2 will support this language.www.dougcanderson.com

The user can navigate from the home page and learn how to play the game, play the game or view the high scores. The objective of the game is to teach children how to identify the object, making the association and then spelling the object. Some of the features are: 

User lands on home page, and can click on Play to begin playing. 
The user identifies the image, in this case a teddy bear and begins guessing the letters.
The user then gets four misses, meaning if they chose a letter that was not represented by the name of the image, they would get an x. 
If the user gets four x's, they must start again and they lose 10 points. 
The user can navigate home or check their score from any page in the app
